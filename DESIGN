File System Layout:

  - 1MB = 256 pages (4k blocks)
  - page 0 = bitmaps for pages and inodes
  - page 1 = version control (copy on write functionality)
  - page 2 = inodes
  - page 3-256 = data blocks

Version update function locations:
  - storage_mknod();
  - storage_write();
  - storage_truncate();
  - storage_rename();
  - storage_link();
  - storage_symlink();
  - storage_unlink();
  - storage_set_time();
  - nufs_chmod();

Basic plan for garbage collection
  - go through every single valid version of filesystem
  - compile a massive set of their inums that they reference
  - sort the set if you can, maybe qsort it or something
  - loop through ii = 0 ... INODE_COUNT 
    - if ii NOT IN set
      - inode_free(ii)
  - OOOH GOOD IDEA IS TO USE A BITMAP INSTEAD OF SOME ARRAY SET SORT STRUCTURE!!!!!
